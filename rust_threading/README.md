# basic threading Rust

Basically my third project in Rustlang, to know some basics about multithreading and memory management in this language. 
Nothing exceptional here. More multithreading and other things 
in [rust_sdl2_test](https://github.com/michal2229/Rust-playground/tree/master/rust_sdl2_test) particle simulation project.
