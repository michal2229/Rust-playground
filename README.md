## where am I?

This is my repository containing code, which I emitted during learning Rust language. 

I like graphics and high performance computing, so topics 
like OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenCL etc. will probably constitute majority of this repo.

Previously I coded mostly in Python3 (NumPy and PyOpenCL for performance, micropython for embedded), so using Rust is quite a change for me. 
I think I am starting to understand the spirit of this language...
