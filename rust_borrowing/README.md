# Basic Rust borrowing 

This project was my getle introduction to Rustlang, basically the second project after HelloWorld :) 
It doesn'd do anything meaningful, just some references, borrowing, scopes, Strings, mutability, project building...

It behaves quite different than other low-level languages, 
it is somewhat harder than C/C++, which I am more familiar with, 
but it seems more elegant and safe. Debug messages from *rustc* compiler are way more clear than gcc/g++/llvm ones, 
so the difficulty quite cancel out. 

After playing a bit, one could say it behave like a language more high level than C/C++,
with many high-level features, which makes You write better and safer code, with low-level language performance. 
*Zero-cost abstractions* they call it. I quite like it. 

And it has no garbage collector.
